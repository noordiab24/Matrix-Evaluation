This project provides users the tools to apply matrix operations on matrices with varying properties - reflexive, symmetric, transitive, anti-reflexive, etc. The matrix operations provided include displaying a matrix, copying a matrix, summing 2 matrices, multiplying 2 matrices, and applying transitive closure on a matrix.
